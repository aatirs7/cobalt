/**
 * Removes the aps-environment entitlement.
 *
 * expo-notifications ships a config plugin that Expo auto-applies whenever the
 * package is installed, and it adds aps-environment unconditionally. That
 * entitlement requires the Push Notifications capability on the provisioning
 * profile, and a build fails outright when the profile lacks it.
 *
 * Cobalt only ever schedules local notifications for the single daily reminder.
 * Base spec section 8 excludes push notifications entirely, so the capability
 * is not merely unnecessary, it is something the product has committed not to
 * use. Stripping it keeps the entitlements honest and keeps the profile simple.
 *
 * Listed last in app.json so it runs after the auto-applied plugin and wins.
